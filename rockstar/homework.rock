Government wants my house
While my house ain't like Kensington,
print " "
Knock my house down, baby

My score is nothing
My note is "A"
My money is like a goldsmiths

While my money ain't like retirement,
    print my note
    Government taking my money
    My delay is like timeitself,
    While my delay ain't 100000,
        Build my delay up, baby
Knock my money down, yeah

My life is a horrifying feverdream
Government taking my life

Listen to the drums
if the drums are my note
