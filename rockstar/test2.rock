Vampire wants my blood
    whisper "Initial blood:" + my blood
    While my blood is greater than 6,
        let my blood be without 6
        Knock my blood down, baby
    Put my blood into your mouth
    Whisper "mod 6: " + my blood
    Give it back

My blood is 14
Let my val be Vampire taking my blood
print my blood
print my val

The note at 0 is "A"
The note at 1 is "B"
The note at 2 is "C"
The note at 3 is "D"
The note at 4 is "E"
The note at 5 is "F"
The note at 6 is "G"

Rock pattern

my loop is 0

while my loop ain't like a roundabout,
    whisper "Iteration " + my loop
    let my val be with my loop
    let my result be Vampire taking my val
    Let my pattern at my loop be the note at my result
    Build my loop up, baby

print my pattern
